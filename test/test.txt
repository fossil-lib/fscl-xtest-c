A trilobite is an ancient, extinct marine arthropod that thrived in Earth's oceans for over 270 million years. These creatures, characterized by their segmented bodies and hard exoskeletons, existed in a wide range of sizes and shapes during the Paleozoic era. Trilobites are renowned for their remarkable diversity and are considered some of the earliest and most successful arthropods in Earth's history. While they are long gone, their fossils provide valuable insights into the ancient oceans and the evolution of life on our planet.
